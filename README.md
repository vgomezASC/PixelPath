# MusicImg
MusicImg (the temporary name) is a web app that lets you create an image from an image file (for now it's PNG only).
It works by going pixel by pixel and grabbing the RGBA values of the pixel, and pairing it with sound files.
Currently a user may select the entire image, or create a path that lets you draw out what you want converted.

##status
pixellation has been implemented, and we are currently working on fixing bugs and overall smoothing things out.
if we're lucky we'll have a presentable product by judging time.

##more about
This app was built as part of hackCooper 2016 by the team Free Swag.
